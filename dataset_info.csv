Mama he treats your daughter mean 
Mama he treats your daughter mean 
He's the meanest man I've ever seen 

Mama he treats me badly 
Makes me love him madly 
Mama he takes my money 
Makes me call him honey 

Mama he can't be trusted 
He makes me so disgusted 
All of my friends they don't understand 
What's the matter with this man 

I tell you mama he treats your daughter mean 
Mama he treats your daughter mean 
Mama he treats your daughter mean 
He's the meanest man I've ever seen 

Mama this man is lazy 
Almost drives me crazy 
Mama he makes me squeeze him 
Still my squeezes don't please him 

Mama my heart is aching 
I believe it's breaking 
I've stood all that I can stand 
What's the matter with this man? 

I tell you Mama he treats your daughter mean 
Mama he treats your daughter mean 
Mama he treats your daughter mean

1,Along Came Jones,Coasters,50 Coastin' Classics: Anthology,003.mp3,"I plopped down in my easy chair and turned on Channel 2
A bad gunslinger called Salty Sam was chasin' poor Sweet Sue
He trapped her in the old sawmill and said with an evil laugh,
""If you don't give me the deed to your ranch
I'll saw you all in half!""
And then he grabbed her (and then)
He tied her up (and then)
He turned on the bandsaw (and then, and then...!)

[Chorus:]
And then along came Jones
Tall thin Jones
Slow-walkin' Jones
Slow-talkin' Jones
Along came long, lean, lanky Jones

Commercial came on, so I got up to get myself a snack
You should've seen what was goin' on by the time that I got back
Down in the old abandoned mine, Sweet Sue was havin' fits
That villain said, ""Give me the deed to your ranch
Or I'll blow you all to bits!""
And then he grabbed her (and then)
He tied her up (and then)
He lit the fuse to the dynamite (and then, and then...!)

[Chorus]

I got so bugged I turned it off and turned on another show
But there was the same old shoot-'em-up and the same old rodeo
Salty Sam was tryin' to stuff Sweet Sue in a burlap sack
He said, ""If you don't give me the deed to your ranch
I'm gonna throw you on the railroad tracks!""
And then he grabbed her (and then)
He tied her up (and then)
He threw her on the railroad tracks (and then)
A train started comin' (and then, and then...!)

You told me to go up the block
And get you a strawberry pop
When I got back to the flat
You had burned rubber out the back

I went to the closet and saw no clothes
All I saw was hangers and poles
I went to the phone and called your mother

Or have I finally found something worth living for? 
I was looking for some action

To spend your days in the sunshine

You gotta make it happen! 
Is it worth the aggravation 
To find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for?

I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a range rover (c'mon)
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go (hot shit!)
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

You can find me, in St. Louis rolling on dubs
Smoking on dubs in clubs, blowing up like cocoa puffs
Sipping bud, getting perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, accumulated enough stretch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted, fans fainted, while I'm entertaining
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hanging
I hang with Hannibal Lector (hot shit!) so feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud (what?) I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
Run a mile, for the cause, I'm righteous above the law
Player my style's raw, I'm ""born to mack"" like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame, and the glamor
Give me d's with a rubber hammer
My grammar be's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
Fuck bionic it's ironic, slamming niggas like onyx
Lunatics til the day I die
I run more game than the bulls and sonics

Who say pretty boys can't be wild niggas?
Loud niggas, o.k. corral niggas
Foul niggas, run in the club and bust in the crowd nigga
How nigga? ask me again and it's going down nigga

Pound niggas, what you be giving when I'm around nigga
Frown niggas, talking shit when I leave the town nigga
Say now, can you hoes come out to play now
Hey I'm, ready to cut you up any day now
Play by, my rules boo and you gon' stay high
May I, answer yo' third question like A.I.
Say hi, to my niggas left in the slamma
From St. Louis to Memphis
From Texas back up to Indiana, Chi-town
K.c. Motown to Alabama
L.A., New York Yankee niggas to Hotlanta
Louisiana, all my niggas wit ""country grammar""
Smoking blunts in Savannah
Blow thirty mill' like I'm hammer

Let's show these cats to make these millions
So you niggas quit acting silly, mon
Kid quicker than Billy, mon
Talking really and I need it mon
Foes I kick em freely mon, especially off remi, mon
Keys to my beemer, mon, holla at Beenie Man
See me, mon, cheifin' rolling deeper than any mon
Through Jennings mon, through you-city back up to Kingsland
Wit nice niggas, sheist niggas who snatch yo' life niggas
Trife niggas, who produce and sell the same beat twice, nigga

From broke to having dough, cause my price range is rover
Now I'm knocking like Jehovah, let me in now, let me in now

In the drunk tank
An old man said to me, wont see another one
And then he sang a song
The rare old mountain dew
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen to one
Ive got a feeling
This years for me and you
So happy christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

Theyve got cars big as bars
Theyve got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you
Its no place for the old
When you first took my hand
On a cold christmas eve
You promised me
Broadway was waiting for me

You were handsome
You were pretty
Queen of new york city
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging,
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

The boys of the nypd choir
Were singing galway bay
And the bells were ringing out
For christmas day

Youre a bum
Youre a punk
Youre an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy christmas your arse
I pray God its our last

I could have been someone
Well so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Cant make it all alone
Ive built my dreams around you

Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you
Thinking of this, you keep repeating you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
And you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Dance wit the speaker 'till you hear it blow,
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control
your body to dance (You got it) soul,
Ditects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, so let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines,
I escape when I finish the rhyme...
I got soul

You got it (4x)
I know you got soul

Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I'll experiment like a scientist
You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next? then you gotta have soul
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The R, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you wanna get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme

Forget it and don't waste your time
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it (5x)

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came
To teach those who can't say my name
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller
Rakim gets stronger as I get older
Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the R's requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
'Cause almost anyone can relate to...
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let him melt?
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
I'm not bold just cuz I rock gold
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it (4x)

Now I'm a stop to see what you got
Get off the mic before I get too hot
I want to see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound,
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound,
Even other states come right and exact,
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Since you came here, you have to show and prove
And do that dance until it don't move
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release,
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

17,Saturday Night Fish Fry,"Jordan, Louis [1]",Best of Louis Jordan [MCA],024.mp3,"Now if you've ever been down to New Orleans
Then you can understand just what i mean
All thru the week it's quiet as a mouse
But on saturday night they go from house to house
You don't have to pay the usual admission
If you're a cook, a waiter or a good musician
So if you happen to be just passin' by
Stop in at the saturday night fish fry

It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn

Now my buddy and me was on the main stem
Foolin' around just me and him
We decided we could use a little something to eat
So we went to a house on rampart street
We knocked on the door and it opened up with ease
And a lush little miss said, ""come in, please""
And before we could even bat an eye
We were right in the middle of a big fish fry

It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn

Now the folks was havin' the time of their life
And sam was jivin' jimmie's wife
Over in the corner was a beat up grand
Being played by a big fat piano man
Some of the chicks wore expensive frocks
Some of them had on bobbie socks
But everybody was nice and high
At this particular saturday night fish fry

It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn

70,I Have a Dream,"King, Martin Luther Jr.",In Search of Freedom,088.mp3,"I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.

Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon of hope to millions of slaves, who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, the colored America is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the colored American is still sadly crippled by the manacle of segregation and the chains of discrimination.

One hundred years later, the colored American lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the colored American is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.

In a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our great republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.

This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed to the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given its colored people a bad check, a check that has come back marked ""insufficient funds.""

But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and security of justice.

We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is not time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.

Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy.

Now it the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.

Now it the time to lift our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.

Now is the time to make justice a reality to all of God's children.

It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the determination of it's colored citizens. This sweltering summer of the colored people's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end but a beginning. Those who hope that the colored Americans needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.

There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the colored citizen is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.

We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.

We cannot be satisfied as long as the colored person's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.

We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating ""for white only.""

We cannot be satisfied as long as a colored person in Mississippi cannot vote and a colored person in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.

No, no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.

I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of your trials and tribulations. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by storms of persecutions and staggered by the winds of police brutality.

You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.

Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our modern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.

Let us not wallow in the valley of despair. I say to you, my friends, we have the difficulties of today and tomorrow.

I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed. ""We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.""

I have a dream that one day out in the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by their character.

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

I have a dream today.

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be engulfed, every hill shall be exalted and every mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plains and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.

This is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.

With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.

With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to climb up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.

This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning ""My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring!""

And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. So let freedom ring from the hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado. Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that, let freedom, ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia. Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi and every mountainside.

When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every tenement and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, 

""Free at last, free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.""

But on the Che Guevara highway filling up with gasoline
Fidel Castro's brother spies a rich lady who's crying
Over luxury's disappointment
So he walks over and he's trying
To sympathise with her but he thinks that he should warn her
That the Third World is just around the corner 

In the Soviet Union a scientist is blinded
By the resumption of nuclear testing and he is reminded
That Dr Robert Oppenheimer's optimism fell
At the first hurdle

In the Cheese Pavilion and the only noise I hear
Is the sound of someone stacking chairs
And mopping up spilt beer
And someone asking questions and basking in the light
Of the fifteen fame filled minutes of the fanzine writer

Mixing Pop and Politics he asks me what the use is
I offer him embarrassment and my usual excuses
While looking down the corridor
Out to where the van is waiting
I'm looking for the Great Leap Forwards

Jumble sales are organised and pamphlets have been posted
Even after closing time there's still parties to be hosted
You can be active with the activists
Or sleep in with the sleepers
While you're waiting for the Great Leap Forwards 

One leap forward, two leaps back
Will politics get me the sack?

here comes the future and you can't run from it
If you've got a blacklist I want to be on it

It's a mighty long way down rock 'n roll
From Top of the Pops to drawing the dole

If no one seems to understand
Start your own revolution and cut out the middleman

In a perfect world we'd all sing in tune
But this is reality so give me some room

So join the struggle while you may
The Revolution is just a T-shirt away

Haven't changed, had much to say
But man I still think them cats are great

They were asking if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were living downtown
Driving all the old men crazy

The Boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
(I Said) The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)

You know that chic who used to dance a lot?
Every night she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she got
Man when I tell you she was cool she was red hot
I mean she was steamin'

And that time over at Johnny's place
Well this chic got up and slapped Johnny's face
Man we just fell about the place
What that chic don't wanna know forget 'er

The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
(I said) The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)

Spread the word around
Guess who's back in town
You spread the word around

Friday night they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's bar and grill
The drinks will flow and blood would spill
If the boys wanna fight you better let 'em

That kid rocks down at the corner blasting out my favourite song
The nights are getting warmer and won't be long
Wont be long till the summer comes
Now that the boys are here again

The boys are back in town (the boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town (the boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town (the boys are back in town)
(Spread the word around)

They was out to meet the boys in the band.

Out into orbit moving in one place

Groove that beat-once is never enough.

Oo-wee! Capracornia, here we come! (Here we go!)

Make your move - now you're having some fun. 
Catch my wave, won't you tune in on me?

Her and some friends on an ocean-liner ship 
She made a big mistake by leaving me home 
I had to roam so I picked up the phone 
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down 
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around 
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74 
My mother left a yard but I needed one more 
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks 
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks 
drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit 
Came to a toll, we paid and went through it 
Had no destination, we was on a quest 
Ali laid in the back so he could get rest 
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half 
The sun had just risen on a dusty path 
Just then a figure had caught my eye 
A man with a sombrero who was four feet high 
I pulled over to ask were we was at 
His index finger he tipped up his hat 
""El Segundo,"" he said, ""my name is Pedro 
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto"" 
Needed civilization, some sort of reservation 
He said a mile south, there's a fast food station 
Thanks, senor, as I start up the motor 
Ali said, ""Damn, Tip, why you drive so far for?"" 

(Well describe to me what the wallet looks like) 

Anyway a gas station we passed 
We got gas and went on to get grub 
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere 
Anywhere would have been better 
I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em 
Ali had the fruit punch 
When we finished we thought for ways to get back 
I had a hunch 
Ali said, ""Pay for lunch"" 
So I did it 
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady 
She was a waitress there 
Put the wallet down and stared and stared 
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed,
""Yo, Tip, man, you got what you need?"" 
I checked for keys and started to step 
What do you know, my wallet I forget 

Yo, it was a brown wallet, it had props numbers 
Had my jimmy hats I got to get it man 

Lord, have mercy 
The heat got hotter, Ali stars to curse me 
I fell bad but he makes me feel badder 
Chit-chit-chatter, car stars to scatter 
Breaking on out, we was Northeast bound 
Jettin' on down at the seepd of sound 
Three days coming and three more going 
We get back and there was no slack 
490 Madison, we're here, Sha 
He said, ""All right, Tip, see you tomorrow"" 
Thinking about the past week, the last week 
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak 
Hopped in the car and torpe'ed to the shack 
Of Shaheed, ""We gotta go back"" when he said 
""Why?"" I said, ""We gotta go

I'd surely buy you a Cadillac
Whatever you need

I hope it always will stay this way

Stand up and take a bow

And when we both get older
With walking canes and hair of gray
Have no fear even though it's hard to hear
I will stand real close and say

Thank you for being a friend (I wanna thank you)

When anyone's in love
The crickets sing a happy song

167,Magic Number,De La Soul,3 Feet High and Rising,210.mp3,"(Got to have soul!) 

POS: 
3 
That's the Magic Number 
Yes it is 
It's the magic number 
Somewhere in this hip-hop soul community 
Was born 3 Mase, Dove and me 
And that's the magic number 

(What does it all mean?) 

Difficult preaching is Posdnuos' pleasure 
Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart 
Something that stimulates the music in my measure 
Measure in my music, raised in three parts 
Casually see but don't do like the Soul 
'Cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys 
Doin' hip hop hustle, no rock and roll 
Unless your name's Brewster, 'cause Brewster's a Punky 
Parents let go 'cause there's magic in the air 
Criticising rap shows you're out of order 
Stop look and listen to the phrasin' Fred Astaires 
And don't get offended while Mase do-se-do's your daughter 
A tri-camera rolls since our music's now set 
Fly rhymes are stored on a D.A.I.S.Y. production 
It stands for &quot;Da Inner Sound Y'all&quot; and y'all can bet 
That the action's not a trick, but showing the function 

Everybody wants to be a deejay 
Everybody wants to be an emcee 
But being speakers are the best 
And you don't have to guess 
De La Soul posse consists of three 
And that's the magic number 

DOVE: 
This here piece of the pie 
Is not dessert but the course that we dine 
And three out of every darn time 
The effect is &quot;Mmmm&quot; when a daisy grows in your mind 
Showing true position, this here piece is 
Kissin' the part of the pie that's missin' 
When that negative number fills up the casualty 
Maybe you can subtract it 
You can call it your lucky partner 
Maybe you can call it your adjective 
But odd as it may be 
Without my 1 and 2 where would there be 
My 3 
Mase Pos and Me 
And that's the Magic Number 

Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul 
Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds 
Common are speakers who are never scrolls 
Scrolls written daily creates a new sound 
Listeners listen 'cause this here is wisdom 
Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug 
Set aside a legal substance to feed 'em 
For now get 'em high off this dialect drug 
Time is a factor so it's time to count 
Count not the negative actions of one 
Speakers of soul say it's time to shout 
Three forms the soul to a positive sum 
Dance to this fix and flex every muscle 
Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber 
Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle 
Shake, rattle, roll to my Magic Number 

Now you may try to subtract it 
But it just won't go away 
Three times one? 
(What is it?) 
(One, two, three!) 
And that's the Magic Number 

(Yo, what's up?) 
(1, 2, 3) 
(I say, children, what does it all mean?) 
(Woah-woah-wo, 1, 2, 3) 
(I wouldn't lie to you) 
(No more no less, that's the magic number) 
(No more no less) 
(What it is?) 
(No more no less) 
(Is this the future?) 
(No more no less) 
(Do the shang-a-lang) 
(No more no less) 
(No one on the subway ever chats to me) 
(No more no less) 
(Anybody in the audience ever get hit by a car?) 
(No more no less) 
(How high's the water, mama?) 
(No more no less) 
(How high's the water, mama?) 
(No more no less) 
(Three feet high and rising) 
(No more no less) 
(Three)

We feel deep in love growin' up in Queens 
We didn't know a thing about love 
We was innocent, sneakin' on the doorstep to hug 
Held you tightly and promised you the world 
You gave me hickeys and said you was my girl 
When I think about it now it makes me smile 
'Cause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while 
Funny how you grow up and innocence fades 
We used to live for love but now we're afraid 
{Of what?} 
Of the darkness and bitter memories 
Lovers who crushed us through infidelity 
I promised you I'll love you to the end 
Always and forever, since way back when, uh 
You're like candy, 
The world's sweetest friend 
You taste better now than you did back then

While you suck caramel apple lollypops 
Rain, sleet, or snow I'm troopin' up the Murdock 
We used to walk down the block, hold hands 
I would get you after school 'cause I was your man 
And, any guys that want to socialize 
Just know that I'mma flip on any cat that tries 
My peeps used to say I was whipped 
All your girls said,   Since you got with him you flipped   
But, uh, they couldn't feel the feelings we felt 
Mirrors on the ceiling we melt 
I would look up at ya 
I remember the afternoon you surrendered 
We made love, 
Your temperature was high as could be 
You said,   Todd, promise you ain't lyin' to me   
And as we went our separate ways you turned back 
Smiled, I remember all that

I need your love 
Each and every day 


When I'm alone in my room, 
Sometimes I stare at the wall 
And in the back of my mind, 
I hear my memories call 
For days when love was true, 
I slept and held you 
Taste the brown sugar, 
Let your climax melt you 
Candy, 
You're occupyin' all of my thoughts 
Turned my soul upside down with lessons you taught 
I could feel you 
Even when you're far away you're right here wit' me 
Sweet love strictly 
And I'mma bend over backwards to keep you on my side 
Take you for a mental and emotional ride 
Make love to your soul, 
Your heart, and your mind 
In your hour of need, girl, 
I'll be there every time 
And as long as you support my dreams 
Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team 
I'mma take you where the average man can only dream of 
'Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love

But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale.

Hi-de-hi-de-hi-di-hi! 
Ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho! 
He-de-he-de-he-de-he! 
Ho-de-ho-de-ho! 

Now, she messed around with a bloke named Smoky, 
She loved him though he was cokie, 
He took her down to Chinatown, 
He showed her how to kick the gong around. 

Now, she had a dream about the king of Sweden, 
He gave her things that she was needin', 
He gave her a home built of gold and steel, 
A diamond car with a platinum wheel. 

Now, he gave her his townhouse and his racing horses, 
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses; 
She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes, 
And she sat around and counted them all a billion times.

When it's time to duel, you get two men
Two heaters, one street, one clock
and when it strike twelve one of y'all gon' drop
If you're quick on the draw you're gon' see the morgue
but if you're too slow
I catch you on the downlow (Oh no)
Oh no, you mean The Kid, shit's real
I ain't no John Wayne, these niggas gangbang
The Four Horsemen, that's the click I'm wit
You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers
Yeah, we're on a mission ta Kansas, slippin thru Texas
We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes
bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg
Hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses
The niggas in black, the fearless Four Horsemen
Searchin for this location on the map
The gold rush, baby, got ta have it (I gots ta have it)
It feels just like it's 1865
and a trigger look-a-day is how I ride

(Kurupt)

On and on and on it's more strange
Time to heat, shootin range
Quick with the heat on their hip
Young Jesse James come to test your aim
I seen you at th e Wild Horny Corral
I hearda ya name
Tha forcify, nigga you ain't never lie
Besides I'm in the mood so at high noon we ride
From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach
My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts
The off-the-rocker roller coaster
On a six-shooter holster
with DPG on every Wanted poster
Let me think about which bank to gank
which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank
I want all the shit you got in stacks
attached to this skirt in the corner
so I snatched the bitch in the back
The Dogg in me feels for the lust
but the hogg in me makes me wanna bust
Back to the drawin down board
Nowadays we drawn down more
To survive thru all the round wards
Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene
or get'cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen
I can't help it, I'm heartless, ya can't hack it
With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket
Like that cock back
quick to pull my strap
Just to put the Horsemen on the map
(The gold rush)

(???? from LBC Crew)

Born is Doggystyle, individual, James got the hots
I got the six shots for all the plans and plots
I gots lots o' cash stashed in money bags
Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags
I got stacks so my stacks excell
Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells
I'm on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse
A 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o' course
It ain't no stoppin young Josey
Box all the nosey
Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hos be
Left a dusty trail, bailed in swell
Gold spurs on the Gators, set back the clientele
Oh well, for the recop I drop my bet
Divide between my homies and ride the sunset

(Bad Azz from LBC Crew)

Two sacks o' money from the train heist
They ain't even counted it up
just mounted it up
Rode west toward the coaster, six-shooters in the holster
Pass thru a run-down town whose walls hold my poster
Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat
so I gotta have what I can get
Heard word about the gold rush and headed West
on my white horsey with three straps in my napsack
Giddy up, the next town I rode thru
I had to threaten to blow their city up
Undebts with Chief Black, caught five miles west
sell us some beads and hail us some weed
He offered me a toke
he didn't have a 20 he had they beads-pipe smoke
I almost choked
Break him for the get, right, I'm off into the sunset
tryin ta reach my destiny fast
It's these two bags o' cash
44's cocked I ain't makin no mo' stops
till I hit the spot, I made it twelve on the dot
I slid off my boots, counted my loot
Five minutes after the strike of midnight
I counted 200 Gs, I cocked my strap and slept tight
(At the gold rush, at the gold rush
at the gold rush, at the gold rush
at the, at the, at the)

Go out and find a girl

Tryin to do what those ladies tell us 
Get shot down cause ya over-zealous 
Play hard to get females get jealous 
Okay smarty go to a party 
Girls are scantily clad and showin body 
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her 
But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter 
Next days function high class luncheon 
Food they're serving, you're stone-cold munchin 
Music comes on people start to dance 
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants 
A girl starts walking guys start gawking 
Sits down next to you and starts talking 
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove 
So come on fatso and just bust a move 

Huh, huh, yeah
Just bust a move

You're on a mission and your wishin 
Someone could cure your lonely condition 
Lookin for love in all the wrong places 
No fine girls just ugly faces 
From frustration first inclination 
Is to become a monk and leave the situation 
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope 
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope 
New movie's showin, so you're goin 
Could care less about the five you're blowin 
Theater gets dark just to start the show 
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin in your row 
She's dressed in yellow, she says ""Hello, 
come sit next to me you fine fellow."" 
You run over there without a second to lose 
And what comes next hey bust a move 

You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it -- just bust a move
You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it

In this city ladies look pretty 
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty 
Tell a funny joke just to get some play 
Then you try to make a move and she says, ""No way"" 
Girls are fakin, goodness sakin 
They want the man who brings home the bacon 
Got no money and you got no car 
Then you got no women and there you are 
Some girls are sadistic, materialistic 
Lookin for a man makes them opportunistic 
They're lyin on the beach perpetrating a tan 
So a brother with the money can be their man 
So on the beach you're strollin real high rollin 
Everything you have is yours and not stolen 
A girl runs up with somethin to prove 
So don't just stand there bust a move 

You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it -- just bust a move
You want it
You got it
You want it

Break it down for me fellas

Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry 
In five days from now he's gonna marry 
He's hopin you can make it there if you can 
Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man 
You say neat-o, check your libido 
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo 
The bride walks down just to start the wedding 
And there's one more girl you won't be getting 
So you start thinkin then you start blinking 
A bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking 
She thinks your kinda cute so she winks back 
And now your feelin really firm cause the girl is stacked 
Reception's jumpin, bass is pumpin 
You look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin 
Says she wants to dance to a different groove 
Now you know what to do G bust a move

Keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll
And keep movin' me on.

This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
To keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
You gonna ease my mind, put me there on time
And keep rollin' on.

You've switched your engine, now I ain't got time
For a triflin' woman on my main line
Cause I'm movin' on, you done your daddy wrong
I warned you twice, now you can settle the price
Cause I'm movin' on.

You're gonna want your daddy, but your daddy will say

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street.
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street.
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings.

Dallas, got a soft machine; Houston, too close to New Orleans,
New York's got the ways and means; but just won't let you be, oh no.

Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love,
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home.
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone.

Truckin', like the do-dah man. Once told me ""You've got to play your hand""
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime, if you don't lay'em down,

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me,
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me what a long, strange trip it's been.

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin see, and cocaine,
All a friend can say is ""Ain't it a shame?""

Truckin', up to Buffalo. Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time, you pick a place to go, and just keep truckin' on.

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window.
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel,
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in.

Busted, down on Bourbon Street, set up, like a bowlin' pin.
Knocked down, it get's to wearin' thin. They just won't let you be, oh no.

You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel,
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down.
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin',
Get out of the door and light out and look all around.

Other times I can barely see.

To be respected, and be a girl

Why you gotta tell me if I'm hated
Oh please be careful with me, I'm sensitive

I was thinking, that it might do some good
If we robbed the cynics and took all their food
That way what they believe will have taken place
And we'd give it to everybody who'll have some faith
So please be careful with me, I'm sensitive
And I'd like to stay that way

I have this theory, that if we're told we're bad
Then that's the only idea we'll ever have
But maybe if we are surrounded in beauty
Someday we will become what we see

But how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try

If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high 'To Sir, With Love'

The time has come for closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught me right from wrong and weak from strong
That's a lot to learn, but what can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart 'To Sir, With Love'

And your path is free to walk

Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the backroads
By the rivers of my mem'ry
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that binds me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find 
That you are moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my mem'ry
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman crying to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from the gurglin'
Cracklin' caldron in some train yard
My beard a roughning coal pile and
A dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend I hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the backroads

Take off your coat, my love, and close the door

Don't sleep in the subway, darling
Don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway, darling

You try to be smart, then you take it to heart
'Cause it hurts when your ego is deflated
You don't realize that it's all compromise
And the problems are so overrated

Goodbye means nothing when it's all for show
So why pretend you've somewhere else to go

Don't sleep in the subway, darling

Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor

But the crowd called out for more 
The room was humming harder 
As the ceiling flew away 
When we called out for another drink 
And the waiter brought a tray 

And so it was that later 
As the miller told his tale 
That her face, at first just ghostly, 
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said, ""There is no reason 
And the truth is plain to see."" 
But I wandered through my playing cards 
And they would not let her be 
One of sixteen vestal virgins 
Who were leaving for the coast 
And although my eyes were open wide
They might have just as well been closed 

And so it was that later 
As the miller told his tale 
That her face, at first just ghostly, 
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said, ""I'm here on a shore leave,""
Though we were miles at sea.
I pointed out this detail
And forced her to agree, 
Saying, ""You must be the mermaid
Who took King Neptune for a ride.""
And she smiled at me so sweetly
That my anger straightway died.

And so it was that later 
As the miller told his tale 
That her face, at first just ghostly, 
Turned a whiter shade of pale

If music be the food of love
Then laughter is it's queen
And likewise if behind is in front
Then dirt in truth is clean
My mouth by then like cardboard
Seemed to slip straight through my head
So we crash-dived straightway quickly
And attacked the ocean bed

The sound of laughter in our ears
In the breeze as we would run?

Kiss your face and make you care
About your world

And we would count the evening stars
As the day grew dark

Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlor
And I'll show you how it all went down

Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh, and I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you

`Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with the waves of grain
And I saw my devil, 
and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from 
Cheyenne to Tennessee

We flew straight across that river bridge, 
last night a half past two
The switchman wave his lantern goodbye 
and so long as we went rolling through
Billboards and truckstops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do

And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something 
that I've never been shown

And I saw my devil, 
and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from 
Cheyenne to Tennessee

The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
And lighted out for some desert town

Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh, but I remembered something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true

In my hour of darkness
In my time of need
Oh, Lord grant me vision
Oh, Lord grant me speed

Once I knew a young man
Went driving through the night
Miles and miles without a word
With just his high-beam lights
Who'd have ever though they'd build such
a deadly Denver bend
To be so strong, to take as long as
it would till the end

In my hour of darkness
In my time of need
Oh, Lord grant me vision
Oh, Lord grant me speed

Another young man safely strummed his
silver string guitar
And he played to people everywhere
Some say he was a star
But he was just a country boy,
his simple songs confess
And the music he had in him,
so very few possess

In my hour of darkness
In my time of need
Oh, Lord grant me vision
Oh, Lord grant me speed

Then there was an old man
Kind and wise with age
And he read me just like a book and he
never missed a page
And I loved him like my father
And I loved him like my friend
And I knew his time would shortly come
but I did not know just when

At your jokes when they are so bad
And you're jokes are always bad
But they're not as bad as this

Come join us in a prayer 
We'll be waiting, waiting where 
Everything's ending here 
And all the sterile striking it
Defends an empty dock you cast away
And rain upon your forehead
Where the mist's for hire
If it's just too clear
Let's spend our last
1/4 stance randomly
Go down to the outlet once again
Painted portrait of minions and slaves
Crotch mavens and one night plays
Are they the only ones who laugh?
At the jokes when they are so bad
And the jokes are always bad
But they're not as bad as this

And all the Spanish candles unsold
Have gone away to this
And a ""run-on piece of mount on""
Trembles, shivers runs down the freeway

A fortress deep and mighty,

It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.

But I've heard the words before,
It's sleeping in my memory.
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died.
If I never loved I never would have cried.

And my poetry to protect me,
I am shielded in my armor,
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb.

Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.

That shape is my shade
There where I used to stand
It seems like only yesterday
I gazed through the glass
At ramblers, wild gamblers
That's all in the past

You call me a fool
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real
I already bought the dream
So useless to ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye
I'll make it this time
I'm ready to cross that fine line

I'll learn to work the saxophone
I play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
And I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues

My back to the wall
A victim of laughing chance
This is for me
The essence of true romance
Sharing the things we know and love
With those of my kind
Libations
Sensations
That stagger the mind

I crawl like a viper
Through these suburban streets
Make love to these women
Languid and bittersweet
I'll rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town
A world of my own
I'll make it my home sweet home

I take one last drag
As I approach the stand
I cried when I wrote this song
Sue me if I play too long

I'll be what I want to be

But who could tell in '46 if the two were to survive

Well the years were passing quickly, but not fast enough for him
So he closed his eyes through '55, then he opened them up again
When he looked around he saw a clown and the clown seemed very gay
And he set that night to join that circus clown and run away

Well he followed every railroad track and every highway sign
And he had a girl in each new town and the towns he left behind
And the open road was the only road he knew
But the color of his dreams was slowly turning into blue

Then he met a girl, the kind of girl he wanted all his life
She was soft and kind and good to him, so he took her for his wife
And they got a house not far from town and in a little while
The girl had seen the doctor and she came home with a smile

Of a now late afternoon,
As the sun shines through the curtained lace
And shadows wash the room.
And we sit and drink our coffee
Couched in our indifference,
Like shells upon the shore
You can hear the ocean roar
In the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs,
The borders of our lives.

And you read your Emily Dickinson,
And I my Robert Frost,
And we note our place with bookmarkers
That measure what we've lost.
Like a poem poorly written
We are verses out of rhythm,
Couplets out of rhyme,
In syncopated time
And the dangled conversation
And the superficial sighs,
Are the borders of our lives.

Yes, we speak of things that matter,
With words that must be said,
""Can analysis be worthwhile?""
""Is the theater really dead?""
And how the room is softly faded
And I only kiss your shadow,
I cannot feel your hand,
You're a stranger now unto me
Lost in the dangling conversation.

In the borders of our lives.

        Posing a threat, you bet it's fuckin' up the government
        My plan said I had to get out and break north
        Just like with Oliver's neck
        I had to get off - my boys had the feds in check
        They couldn't do nuthin'
        We had a force to instigate a prison riot
        This is what it takes for peace
        So I just took the piece
        Black for Black inside time to cut the leash
        Freedom to get out - to the ghetto - no sell out
        6 C-Os we got we ought to put their head out
        But I'll give 'em a chance, cause I'm civilized
        As for the rest of the world, they can't realize
        A cell is hell - I'm a rebel so I rebel
        Between bars, got me thinkin' like an animal
        Got a woman C-O to call me a copter
        She tried to get away, and I popped her
        Twice, right
        Now who wanna get nice?
        I had 6 C-Os, now it's 5 to go
        And I'm serious - call me delirious
        But I'm still a captive
        I gotta rap this
        Time to break as time grows intense
        I got the steel in my right hand
        Now I'm lookin' for the fence

        I ventured into the courtyard
        Followed by 52 brothers
        Bruised, battered, and scarred but hard
        Goin' out with a bang
        Ready to bang out
        But power from the sky
        And from the tower shots rang out
        A high number of dose - yes
        And some came close
        Figure I trigger my steel
        Stand and hold my post
        This is what I mean - an anti-nigger machine
        If I come out alive and then they won't - come clean
        And then I threw up my steel bullets - flew up
        Blew up, who shot...
        What, who, the bazooka was who
        And to my rescue, it was the S1Ws
        Secured my getaway, so I just gotaway
        The joint broke, from the black smoke
        Then they saw it was rougher thatn the average bluffer
        'Cause the steel was black, the attitude exact
        Now the chase is on tellin' you to c'mon

Burning clues into this heart of mine

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
Beneath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of
A neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

Fools said I, you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the signs said, the words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls

We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting

And I can't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight

Oh how can I forget you go
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me 

I was born to love you 
And I will never be free 
You'll always be a part of me 
Whoa-ooo-ohhh-oh 
Whoa-oh-ooo-ohhh 

If you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share 
Just come back to the places where we used to go 
And I'll be there

Always something there to remind me

And make believe you love me one more time,

And the coyote bays at the moon.

Where they play a little cowboy tune.
And the guitar picker was a friend of mine

Yea, Randy played her a sweet love song
And Della got a fire in her eye
The Dealer had a knife and the dog had a gun
and the cat had a shot of Rye.

Yea, the dealer was a killer,
He was evil and mean
And he was jealous of the fire in her eyes.

He snorted his coke through a century note
And swore that Boone would die.

The stage was set when the lights went out.
There was death in Tucson town.
Two shadows ran for the bar back door
And one stayed on the ground

Two shadows ran from the bar that night
And dog and cat ran too.

As down the road they flew.

And I split for Memphis where they say all
Them swingin' cats are havin' a ball
Sessions, hot licks and all, they dig me

I was rockin' and boppin' and I's a gettin' the breaks

My mom took me school shopping
It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall

I didn't say nothing at first
I just turned up my nose
She said, ""What's wrong? This shirt cost $20""
I said, ""Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!""
The next half hour was the same old thing
My mother buying me clothes from 1963
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!
I said, ""Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep""
She said, ""You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet""

Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers
But if you don't want to I can live with that but
You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks""
She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same
Inevitably the first day of school came
I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick
But my mom said, ""No, no way, uh-uh, forget it""
There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought
The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought
And those who weren't laughing still had a ball
Because they were pointing and whispering
As I walked down the hall
I got home and told my Mom how my day went
She said, ""If they were laughing you don't need the,
""Cause they're not good friends""
For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom
That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times

My parents went away on a week's vacation and
They left the keys to the brand new Porsche
Would they mind?
Umm, well, of course not
I'll just take it for a little spin
And maybe show it off to a couple of friends
I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood
Well, maybe I shouldn't
Yeah, of course I should
Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking
You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions
I honked my horn just to get her attention
She said, ""Was that for me?""
I said, ""Yeah""
She said, ""Why?""
I said, ""Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy""
She said, ""How do I know you're not sick?
You could be some deranged lunatic""
I said, ""see'mon toots - my name is the Prince =
Beside, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?""
She agreed and we were on our way
She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word
We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive
We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes
She kicked her shoes off onto the floor
She said, ""Drive fast, speed turns me on""
She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas
We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast
The sun roof was open , the music was high
And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh
She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car
We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche
And to make this long story short - short
When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell
I said, ""I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer""
I almost had a heart attack that day
Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway
I was arrested, the car was impounded
There was no way for me to avoid being grounded
My parents had to come off from vacation to get me
I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
My parents walked in
I got my grip, I said, ""Ah, Mom, Dad, how was your trip?""
They didn't speak
I said, ""I want to plead my case""
But my father just shoved me in the car by my face
That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived
They took turns -
One would beat me while the other one was driving
I can't believe it, I just made a mistake

511,Hot Rod Lincoln,Commander Cody & His Lost Planet Airmen,Too Much Fun: Best of Commander Cody,605.mp3,"My pappy said ""Son, you're gonna drive me to drinkin',
if you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard the story of the hot rod race,
where the Fords 'n' Lincolns was settin' the pace?
That story is true, I'm here to say,
that I was drivin' that Model-A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up,
that Model-A body makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders and uses 'em all,
got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a four-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
with 4-11 gears you can really get lost.
Got safety tubes but I ain't scared,
the brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled outta San Pedro late one night,
the moon 'n' the stars was shinin' bright.
We was drivin' up Grapevine hill,
passin' cars like they was standin' still.

All of a sudden in the wink of an eye,
Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said ""Boys that's the mark for me,""
by then the tailight was all you could see.

Now the fellas ribbed me for bein' behind,
so I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas'n'man alive,
I shoved it on down into overdrive.

Wound it up to a hunderd an' ten,
my speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was glued like lead to the floor,
that's all there is an' there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense,
them telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said ""slow down, I see spots,""
the lines on the road just looked like dots.

Took a corner'n'side-swiped a truck,
crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts,
the guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was comin' from outta the back,
when started t' gain on that Cacillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass,
don'tcha by then we'd be low on gas.

We had flames comin' from outta the side,
you could feel the tension, man whatta ride.
I said ""look out boys, I got a license to fly,""
and that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started knockin'
down in the dip she started to rock.
And I looked in the mirror, a red light was blinkin',
the cops was after my hot rod Lincoln.

They arrested me 'n' they put me in jail,
'n they called my pappy to throw my bail,
'n he said ""son you're gonna drive me ta drinkin'
if you don't stop drivin' that hot rod Lincoln.

Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
may have nestled its way into his mighty throat.
Many a fat alley rat had met its demise while staring point blank down
the cavernous barrel of this awesome prowling machine.
Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator.
Tommy the cat had many a story to tell,
But it was a rare occasion such as this that he did.

She came slidin' down the alleyway like butter drippin' off a hot biscuit.
The aroma, the mean scent, was enough to arouse suspicion in even the
oldest of Tigers that hung around the hot spot in those days.
The sight was beyond belief.
Many a head snapped for double - even triple - takes as this vivacious
feline made her her way into the delta of the alleyway where the most
virile of the young tabbys were known to hang out.

They hung in droves. Such a multitude of masculinity could only be
found in one place...
And that was O'malley's Alley.

The air was thick with cat calls (no pun intended),
But not even a muscle in her neck did twitch as she sauntered up into
the heart of the alleyway.
She knew what she wanted.
She was lookin' for that stud bull, she was looking for that he cat.
And that was me.

Tommy the Cat is my name and I say unto thee...

Say baby do you want to lay down by my side
Ah baby do you want to lay down with me

He did the mash 
It caught on in a flash

To the master bedroom where the vampires feast 
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes 
To get a jolt from my electrodes

Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds 
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive 
With their vocal group, &quot;The Crypt-Kicker Five&quot;

And stopped at a little greasy spoon place

Get you one of the greasy hamburgers
All peppered up, lay you up in the

Lifted up the bun, checked 'em out

How about passing the ketchup over

Suddenly, this little bitty green hand
Holding a ketchup bottle came into view
And I freaked cause the guy sitting
Next to me...
WAS A MARTIAN!!!!

Now in twenty-eight years of eating hamburgers
I ain't never run into no Martian
Not at 2:30 in the morning and certainly
Not at a fine scarfing establishment like Eat

And I looked over at him and I said

they're Martian cigarettes
Here, try one

Well, 'bout half hour later
He looked over at me and smiled
Them Martians ain't got
But two teeth in their head
And he said: how do you feel

And I said, well, I feel so good
Yeah, I do, gonna boogie

Meanwhile, back at Eat's
I was still thinking, I said
How come out of all the places
You could have landed
You wound up here

He said: well, according
To my lunar space map
This town here is supposed to be
The boogie capital of the U.S.A

So I asked him, I said
Now, where else you been, boy
And he told me

He said, I've rocked 'em over

526,Grandma Got Run over by a Reindeer,Elmo & Patsy,Dr. Demento Presents: Greatest Xmas Novelty CD,622.mp3,"Grandma got run over by a reindeer,
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve,
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and Grampa, we believe.

She'd been drinkin too much egg-nog,
And we'd begged her not to go,
But she'd forgot her medication 
And she staggered out the door into the snow.

When we found her Christmas morning,
At the scene of the attack, 
She had hoof prints on her forehead,
And incriminating Claus marks on her back.

Grandma got run over by a reindeer,
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve,
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and Grampa, we believe.

Now we're all so proud of Grampa, 
He's been taking this so well,
See him in there watchin football,
Drinkin' beer and playing cards with cousin Mel.

It's not Christmas without Grandma,
All the family's dressed in black,
And we just can't help but wonder,
Should we open up her gifts or send them back?
(SEND THEM BACK!)

Grandma got run over by a reindeer,
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve,
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and Grampa, we believe.


Now the goose is on the table,
And the pudding made of fig, (ahh)
And the blue and silver candles 
That would just have matched the hair in Grandma's wig. 

I've warned all my friends and neigbors,
""Better watch out for yourselves"",
They should never give a license
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves.

Grandma got run over by a reindeer,
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve,
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and Grampa, we believe.

Two hands are sure to slyly meet beneath
The serviette with cocktails for two

When the sun beats down and I lie on the bench,
I can always hear them talk.

There's always been Ethel:
""Jacob, wake up! You've got to tidy your room now.""
And then Mister Lewis:
""Isn't it time that he was out on his own?""
Over the garden wall, two little lovebirds - cuckoo to you!
Keep them moving blades sharp...

I know what I like, and I like what I know;
getting better in your wardrobe, stepping one beyond your show.

Sunday night, Mr Farmer called, said:
""Listen son, you're wasting your time; there's a future for you
in the fire escape trade. Come up to town!""
But I remebered a voice from the past;
""Gambling only plays when you're winning""
- I had to thank old Miss Mort for schooling a failure.
Keep them moving blades sharp...

I know what I like, and I like what I know;
getting better in your wardrobe, stepping one beyond your show.

When the sun beats down and I lie on the bench,
I can always hear them talk.
Me, I'm just a lawnmower - you can tell me by the way I walk.

She went under the covers with her torch
She fell asleep till it was morning
She dreamt about the girl who stole a horse
Judy never felt so good except when she was sleeping
Judy never felt so good except when she was sleeping

Judy, let's go for a walk
We can kiss and do whatever you want
But you will be disappointed
You will fall asleep with ants in your pants
Judy, you're just trying to find and keep the dream of horses
And the song she wrote was Judy and the Dream of Horses
Dream of Horses
You dream of horses

The best looking boys are taken
The best looking girls are staying inside
So Judy, where does that leave you?
Walking the street from morning to night
With a star upon your shoulder lighting up the path that you walk
With a parrot on your shoulder, saying everything when you talk
If you're ever feeling blue
Then write another song about your dream of horses
Write a song about your dream of horses
Call it Judy And The Dream Of Horses

And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in incense and patchouli
So you take her, to find what's waiting inside

And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice and lost your ticket

There's a memory there.
Boats on the lake, unattended now for all to drown

Just like myself they are neglected,
Turn with my eyes to the wall

Said a thing in the air

Cast to the winds
So full of emptiness without her,
Lost in the words that I said.

I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south
And now you dare to look me in the eye

To work it out at all you just pass it by, pass it by

Substitute my coke for gin

And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing.
When you're feeling in the dumps,
Don't be silly chumps.
Just purse your lips and whistle. 
That's the thing.
And...

Always look on the bright side of life.
[whistle]
Always look on the right side of life,
[whistle]

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word.
You must always face the curtain with a bow.
Forget about your sin.
Give the audience a grin.
Enjoy it. It's your last chance, anyhow.
So,...

Always look on the bright side of death,
[whistle]
Just before you draw your terminal breath.
[whistle]

Life's a piece of shit,
When you look at it.
Life's a laugh and death's a joke it's true.
You'll see it's all a show.
Keep 'em laughing as you go.
Just remember that the last laugh is on you.
And...

Always look on the bright side of life.
Always look on the right side of life.
[whistle]

Always look on the bright side of life!
[whistle]
Always look on the bright side of life! 
[whistle]
Always look on the bright side of life!
[whistle]
Always look on the bright side of life!

Always look on the bright side of life!

And how I love those evening classes

It's not much of a career
Trying the handles of parked cars

Just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

Just last week when I was walking down the street
I observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet
I walked up to her I said hello
She said you're kind of cute I said yes I know
But by the way sweetheart what's your name
She said my friends like to call me exotic elaine
I said my name is the prince and she said why
I said well I don't know I'm just a hell of a guy
But enough about me yo let's talk about you
And all the wonderful things that you and I can do
I popped some cash and in a little bit of time
I showed some cash and the girl was mine
I took her over town I wined her and dined her
She ask me did I like her I said well kinda
All of a sudden she jumped out her seat
Snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street
She started grabbin all over me kissing and hugging
So I shoved her away I said you better stop buggin
She got mad looked me dead in my face
Threw her hands in the air and yelled out rape
I got scared when she started to yell
So I handed her my wallet and ran like hell
I was duckin through alleys right and left
But when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death
I was arrested charged with agrivated assault
(yo clancy we got him)
But it wasn't my fault

But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play

I was in a bar one friday night
Cooling watching a mike tyson fight
I was maxin and relaxin sippin on tequilla
When this girl walked up she said hi my name is sheila
I responded by saying hello
She paid for my drink and then said let's go
20 minutes later things were starting to cook
As we pulled up into her house I said I'm with you toots
The music was soft and there was wine in the glasses
She started winking and making little passes
At me she pat me close that's when she got bold
She started feeling up my back I said oh your hands are cold
We went to her bedroom thinking of one thing
Took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring
I carresed her body and I kissed her cheek
And that's when I observed those satin bed sheets
I felt that it was time for me to make my move
I thought I better hurry up before I busted a groove
I leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue
A door slammed and a voice said baby where are you
Her boyfriend busted in he grinned an evil grin
And said boy I'm a tear your butt limb from limb
I was scared as hell where I was supposed to go
I just yelled geronimo and jumped out the window
Just my luck we were in a snow storm
And all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm
And to top the night off I had to break in my place
Because my keys were on pants back on sheila's book case
I was done sneezing and coughing
I hope this doesn't happen to often
But nevertheless don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhymes and get the hell away

Got funky fresh dressed in my la cox ? ? ? ? 
Got to betty's at eight I was ready to jet
Until betty's mon said betty's not ready yet
I sat there for at least an hour
It was ten after nine before she got in the shower
9:35 she comes downstairs
And said I need a little longer to finish my hair
At ten o'clock we had then missed the show
She comes downstairs and says let's go
Go where go to sleep I'm gone
I was steamin like a demon as I drove home
But it just goes to show

And the stacks will light up, will fuck the night up
blow everything in sight up
fuck around and I'll have your ass right up
What makes you think, you wasn't able to stand
I got shit that'll disable a man with the wave of a hand
The days are longer and seems like I'm wastin time
I've got a lot of dreams but I'm not really chasin mine
I suck it all up like a sicka fly
Cause nowadays gettin' by, nothing more than an occasional meal and
gettin high, I live to die, That's where I'm headed

And there's at least a thousand of us like me mobbin the street
When we starve and we eat whatever's there
Come on you know the code in the street, whatever's fair
Blood stains and chalk, cause yo man couldn't walk
After the talk, heard him out at 1133 of New York
Transformin us niggaz so get it quick
You know for real that nigga can't fuckin suck my dick
And it's gon' take all these niggaz in the rap game
to barely move me, cause when I blow s..t up
I have niggaz fallin' like white bitches in a scary movie
Ah, you know I don't know how to act
Get too close to niggaz, it's like:
""Protected by viper, stand back""

Why do u riff with me, the maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready cuz it might go
BLAAAAW, how ya like me now?
The river will not allow

And I came up with a funky rhyme

Get out your mat and pray to the west,
I'll get out mine and pray for myself.
Thought you were smart when you took them on,
But you didn't take a peep in their artillery room,
All that rugby puts hairs on your chest,
What chance have you got against a tie and a crest.

Hello-hurrah - what a nice day - for the eton rifles,
Hello-hurrah - i hope rain stops play - with the eton rifles.

Thought you were clever when you lit the fuse,
Tore down the house of commons in your brand new shoes,
Compose a revolutionary symphony,
Then went to bed with a charming young thing.

Hello-hurrah - cheers then mate - its the eton rifles,
Hello-hurrah - an extremist scrape - with the eton rifles.

What a catalyst you turned out to be,
Loaded the guns then you run off home for your tea,
Left me standing - like a guilty (naughty) schoolboy.

We came out of it naturally the worst,
Beaten and bloody and i was sick down my shirt,
We were no match for their untamed wit,
Though some of the lads said they'll be back next week.

Hello-hurrah - there's a price to pay - to the eton rifles,
Hello-hurrah - i'd prefer the plague - to the eton rifles.

And she's quivering in fright...

And I catch the evening news.

And he donates his sight to science.

I smash the light in anger.
Push my bed against the door.
I close my lids across my eyes,
And wish to see no more.

And sends them to the brain.
No guarantee the stimuli must be perceived the same...

And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy

And this bag of this weed 
It gives me the shit needed to be 

The most meanest MC on this   on this earth 
'Cause since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse 
And just blurt this bezerk and bizarre shit that works 
And it sells and it helps in its self 

To relieve all this tension dispensing me 
Sentence is getting it, stress has been eating me recently 
Off my chest and I rest to get peacefully 
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone 

When you freaks see me out in the streets when I'm eating or feedin' my daughter 
To not come and speak to me 
I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuck anything 
I'm not Mr. NSYNC and I'm not what your friends think 

I'm not Mr. Friendly 
I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty 
No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet 
In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you 

Go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit 
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe 
I'm tired of all you - I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be 
It's just me

If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

Radio won't even play my jam 
'Cause I am 
Whatever you say I am 
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? 
In the papers, the news, everyday I am 
I don't know it's just the way I am 

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered 
With all of this nonsense it's constant 
And ""oh it's his lyrical content!"" 
The song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses 

And all of this controversy circles me 
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me 
So I point one back at 'em 
But not the index or the pinky or the ring or the thumb 

It's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck 
When you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull 
'Cause they full of shit too 
When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school 

And they blame it on Marilyn - and the heroin 
Where were the parents at? 
And look at where it's at middle America 
Now it's a tragedy 

Now it's so sad to see 
An upper class city having this happening 
Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way 
But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel 
That I need for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and I have returned 

[Chorus]

I'm so sick and tired of being admired 
That I wish that I would just die or get fired 
And drop from my label and stop with the fables 
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""my name is"" 

And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations 
They cop me rotation at Rock 'N' Roll stations 
And I just do not have the patience 
To deal with these cocky Caucasians 

Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black 
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls 
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions 
What school did I go to? 

What hood I grew up in? 
The why? The who, what? 
When and where and the how? 
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out 

You've been driving me crazy, I can't take it 
I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit 
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get 
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom 

Without someone standing by it 
No I won't sign your autograph 
You can call me an asshole 
I'm glad cause

They really think we're getting out of control.

I wanna bite that hand so badly.
I want to make them wish they'd never seen me.

and they worry about the times ahead
But everybody else is overwhelmed by indifference
and the promise of an early bed
You either shut up or get cut out; they don't wanna hear about it.
It's only inches on the reel-to-reel.
And the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools

Reaching twisted claws on every side

No turning back on a suicide ride

To criticize me some crime -- never the less

More chances to remember some things
So I couldn't have so much pressure on my ...
On my ... on my, um ... ah, on my ... um ... um ... head

We'd have so much more diversity,
And so much more input, so much more creative flow,
If we had someone in school, a 'GIT' ...
